# ScientificMethodology
Scientific Methodology and Experimental Evaluation course from Distributed and Cloud Computing Master's at Grenoble INP. 

### Homeworks (1) - Introduction to the scientific method and computer science epistemology | Presentation of the lecture

[ x ] Read Popper’s text   
[ x ] Indicate your name on the Pad. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.  
[ x ] Register on the Mattermost through this invitation link. This is the preferred communication mode.  
[ x ] Set up a public github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.  
[ x ] Register to the MOOC on Reproducible Research  
[ x ] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on Challenger; watching interviews is optional)  
[ x ] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio or Jupyter on your laptop or through the UGA JupyterHub).  
[ x ] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the Pad.  


### Homeworks (2) - Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis | Descriptive statistics; Correlation, causality, and spurious correlation

[ x ] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources) (slides 14-20)  
[ x ] Complete the two data analysis/visualization in a clean R notebook and upload in your github/gitlab space. Make sure we can easily find it when landing on your page. :)  
[ x ] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.  


### Homeworks (3) - Data curation with the tidyverse | Data management 1 (Data Management Plans)

[ x ] See previous homeworks and provide links in the Pad!  
[ x ] First name/last name analysis in a computational document.  

### Homeworks (4) - Beautiful Viz with ggplot | Data management 2  

[ x ] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.  
[ x ] See previous homeworks: use dplyr and ggplot for the first/last name analysis! Complete challenger if you haven’t done so.  
[ ] If you have time, git a try to git-annex but no worry if you can’t. What’s important is that you know it exists, what it allows to do, and that it is not so difficult to use.  
[ x ] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and chood a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).  


### Homework (5) - Measurement and tracing

[ x ] Continue the hands-on, improve the experiment design and the analysis  

### Homework (6) - Clearly defining the experiment and having the right tools to analyze it

[ x ] Write an in-depth report using a computational document with a decent data management/statistical treatment (i.e., with confidence intervals or regions!). You have two options:  

* Use the quicksort or the Fitt’s law hands on.  
  - Formally state the question, identify parameters, propose an evaluation protocol with at least two configurations, perform a proper statistical analysis, provide interpretations and conclude if it is possible. It you cannot conclude, explain why. In any case discuss possible further investigations.  

* Pick one of the seven subjects proposed in the peer evaluation of the MOOC. Subject 2 is too easy and is not an option.
  - Subject 1: CO2 concentration in the atmosphere since 1958
  - Subject 2: purchasing power of English workers from the 16th to the 19th century
  - Subject 3: the London cholera epidemic of 1854
  - Subject 4: latency and capacity estimation for a network connection from asymmetric measurements
  - Subject 5: Dialogue analysis in L’Avare of Molière
  - **Subject 6: Around Simpson’s Paradox**
  - Subject 7: The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) epidemi

Chosen: In-depth report on "Around Simpson’s Paradox".

### Homework (7) - The linear model

* No homework so far  


### Homework (8) - Multiple testing and ANOVA (p-hacking)

* No homework so far
