We studied data visualisation. 

To understand the quality of the visualisation, we should know how is the target audience. If it's a specialized audience, we can include more detailed and in depth information. Otherwise, we need to include only the necessary information to deliver the message. 

We should also pay attention to make it accessible for the readers. This means making it readable for color blinded people, making it possible to read when printed in black and white, etc.

The teacher gave us a sheet to judge a graph.
