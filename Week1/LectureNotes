* We talked about what is science, and how sometimes we consider things as science when they actually aren't.  


* Back and forth between theory and experimentation Automatic abstraction transform.

* A scientific fact is an hypothesis that have been confirmed by a specific experience.  


The text from Popper's discuss what is actually a scientific theory. It gives examples such as the theory of relativity from Einstein, Freud and Adler's theories and astrology. 

In both Freud and Adler's theory and astrology, we have vague affirmations and predictions, making them irrefutable. Therefore, this makes them non-scientific. 

Usually we can't prove that a theory is correct, but we can prove we didn't contradict it.
